# CartTracker
This is just a side-project that I'm working on.  The inspiration comes from the fact that I want to make sure I'm buying the
items that I should be buying and not getting excess items that I don't need.  It's essentially a life skill I've yet to master.

To make sure that I'm buying the items that I said I'm going to buy, and to practice with Web APIs, Databases, and future
front-end technologies on the browser, as well iOS and Android development.
