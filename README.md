# CartTracker
This is just a side-project that I'm working on.  The inspiration comes from the fact that I want to make sure I'm buying the
items that I should be buying and not getting excess items that I don't need.  I'm sure we've all been there at one point :D

To make sure that I'm buying the items that I said I'm going to buy, and to practice with Web APIs, Databases, and future
front-end technologies on the browser, as well iOS and Android development.

And while I could have just downloaded an existing application that does this for me, I would be missing out on all of the lessons
that this project would offer me.  So, I consider it a win-win :)
